Public URL for my S3 Bucket from kvdb.io
Because udacity session is alive only 3 hours.
I will try to keep the server online from 9 A.M  (GMT+7)  to 9 P.M  (GMT+7)
I hope you could arrange your time to review my submission in that time.

If not, I will redeploy my project 9 A.M  (GMT+7)  every day, and you can refresh the link below to get new url.

Thank you very much.
